   Grocery Tracker App
</h1>
 
Cross platform application that will keep track of the groceries that are bought on a per home basis.

## How this will work
- Expo will be used. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.expo.io/)
    - Try to play around with it to get a better feel for this framework 

- The entries will be stored on a AWS database, probably dynamoDB because it'll make things simpler.
    - You can find a tutorial [here](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/design-a-database-for-a-mobile-app-with-dynamodb/)
    - the connection to the DB will be done through AWS amplify which you can read about [here](https://blog.expo.io/how-to-build-cloud-powered-mobile-apps-with-expo-aws-amplify-2fddc898f9a2)
